                This is my character, Mr Eclectic. I created him on Friday July 6, 2018. I've played 109 days, 11 hours, and 36 minutes total 
                (No, I don't live in my mom's basement... anymore.) 
            </p>

            <p>
                One of my favorite activities in-game is killing a dragon powerful dragon named "Vorkath". Vorkath drops valuable loot,
                and upon each death has a chance to drop his sought-after pet, Vorki, which is a miniature representation of himself that
                can follow you around.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also enjoy training my skills to accomplish personal in-game goals. 
                The game has sets of challenges related to specific in-game landmasses called achievement diaries. Completing these
                rewards you with powerful items and bonuses. To complete each level of an acheivement diary, you will often need certain
                skills to be a high enough level. I like researching and picking achievement diaries with powerful rewards and training my skills
                to complete them and unlock the awards.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, I find it very fulfilling to research the game's activities and items on the wiki. Each new method and item
                I learn about adds to my collection of knowledge and provides me an intense sense of satisfaction.
