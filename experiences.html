                    <li> Playing With Friends

                                My brother and his friends sparked my initial interest in Runescape. I would sit and watch them play at a friend's house.
                                We didn't have a computer that could play it, but my grandparents did. Sometimes, we'd go up there and play.
                                Eventually, my friend, Aaron, and I made our own accounts at his house. We'd take turns playing.
                                Even though it was against the rules, we decided to just play on one account. That way, we could make faster progress.
                                I eventually made a friend named Lawson. He and his older brother started playing as well. I remember during the winter, we played during the Christmas event while we were at his house.

                                I really looked up to my brother and his friends. I think that's why I wanted to play so badly. I saw what him and his friends did,
                                and started playing with my friends when I could. I have a lot of fond memories of Runescape while growing up.

                    <li> Getting Scammed...
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                As a naive kid, I got scammed for my items and gold in game a couple times. 
                                The first time, in elementary school, I lost a valuable set of armor. Someone told me to follow them so I could make money. 
                                I ended up dying and they took my gear.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The next time, when I was in middle school, I payed someone almost all of my gold to join their clan.
                                They then blocked me and I was never able to joint he clan or get my money back.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                These experiences made me very sad at the time. However, they helped me learn to be less trusting of strangers on the internet without
                                paying too high of a price.
