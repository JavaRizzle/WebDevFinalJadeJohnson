                    <li> Playing With Friends
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                My brother and his friends sparked my initial interest in Runescape. I would sit and watch them play for hours.
                                We didn't have a computer, but my grandparents did. They lived right next door, so we'd often go up there and play.
                                Eventually, my friend and I made our own accounts. We'd take turns playing at his house.
                                Even though it was against the rules, we eventually decided to just play on one account. That way, we could make faster progress.
                                One winter, I vividly remember we played during the in-game Christmas event at his house.

                                I really looked up to my brother and his friends. I think that's why I wanted to play so badly. I saw what him and his friends did,
                                and started playing with my friends when I could. I have a lot of fond memories of Runescape from my childhood.

                    <li> Getting Scammed...
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                They aren't all fond, though. As a naive kid, I got scammed for my items and gold in-game.
                                In elementary school, I lost a valuable set of armor. Someone convinced me to follow them so they could show me a money-making secret. 
                                They killed me and took my gear.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Later on, in middle school, I payed someone almost all of my gold to join their clan.
                                They proceeded to block me, and I was never able to join their clan or recover my stolen gold.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                These experiences made me very sad at the time; however, they taught me the danger in blindly trusting strangers without
                                paying a significant price.
