            <p> Jagex is the british developer and publisher of OSRS. Founded in 1999 by brothers Andrew and Paul Gower,
                it's since changed hands multiple times. From 2016-2020, it was owned by a Chinese investment company. 
                Most recently, it was acquired by CVC Capital Partners for £910 million in 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2002, when the first pay-to-play version of Runescape 1 was released by Jagex, they garnered 2,000
                subscribers in the first hour, and over 5,000 subscribers in the first week. 11 years after it's launch,
                they touted an impressive 200 million accounts. In 2019, Jagex had an impressive 1.1 million accounts with
                active pay-to-play subscriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Runescape and its variations aren't the only acheivements under Jagex's belt. They've released
                over 30 games spanning a period of over 20 years. Not many video game studios can claim this level of achievement.
